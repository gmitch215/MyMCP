# MyMCP - OpenAPI to MCP Server Converter

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy%20to-Cloudflare%20Workers-orange)](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)

**MyMCP** is a powerful serverless application that dynamically converts any OpenAPI v3 specification into a fully-functional Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Deploy it once, and instantly expose any OpenAPI-compliant API as an MCP-compatible interface with tools, streaming, and more.

üåê **Live Instance**: [mymcp.gmitch215.xyz](https://mymcp.gmitch215.xyz)

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Point to OpenAPI Spec**: Access any OpenAPI URL via `/{server}` endpoint
2. **Automatic Conversion**: MyMCP fetches and parses the OpenAPI specification
3. **Tool Generation**: Each API endpoint becomes an MCP tool with proper schemas
4. **Invoke & Stream**: Use standard MCP protocols to invoke tools or stream results

```txt
https://mymcp.gmitch215.xyz/{server}/sse
```

```bash
# example servers
https://mymcp.gmitch215.xyz/api.example.com/sse
https://mymcp.gmitch215.xyz/https://api.openapi-specification.org/openapi.json/sse

# pre configured server (tabroom)
https://mymcp.gmitch215.xyz/tabroom/sse
```

Ensure that you properly encode the `{server}` portion to avoid invalid paths.

## üìñ Usage

MyMCP supports the official Model Context Protocol specification (2024-11-05). This means you can connect it directly to Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Supported MCP Methods

- ‚úÖ `initialize` - Initialize connection with protocol version and capabilities
- ‚úÖ `tools/list` - List all available API endpoints as tools
- ‚úÖ `tools/call` - Execute API calls through the MCP interface
- ‚úÖ `prompts/list` - Discover available prompts (auto-generated from endpoints)
- ‚úÖ `resources/list` - List resources (empty, extensible for future use)
- ‚úÖ `resources/templates/list` - List resource templates (empty, extensible)
- ‚úÖ `notifications/initialized` - Client initialization notification
- ‚úÖ `ping` - Connection health check

### üîß Pre-configured Servers

MyMCP comes with pre-configured aliases for common APIs. You can add more in `src/servers.json`.
